Docker containerization help to create different platform agnostic and hardware agnostic environments on same machine. For example, if an application need linux operating system to perform its operation, it is feasible on mac/window or other operating system by making docker container. 

In this tutorial, we will focus on installation and creation of docker container specifically on GPU servers. so, if you are new to docker, more detailed explainations are available at https://docker-curriculum.com/

Basic docker commands can also be played in its playground available at https://labs.play-with-docker.com/


### GPU integrated Servers

GPU enabled servers need cuda or (cuda + cudnn) drivers which provide parallel computing platform and programming model to develop GPU-accelerated applications. Therefore, it is mandatory to install these drivers.

To check whether these drivers are installed. Use the following command:

``` nvidia-smi ``` or ``` nvcc --version ```

In case of unavailability of cuda drivers use this [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#package-manager-installation) to install them. 


If docker is already installed in your machine, existing version of docker can be identified using following command:

```
docker version
```

If Docker version is less or equal to 19.02 , GPU can be accessible from inside dockerâ€™s containers using plugin called ``` nvidia-docker ```. 

To install ``` nvidia-docker ``` plugin, 

Step 1: Remove NVIDIA docker 1.0 (if installed)

```
docker volume ls -q -f driver=nvidia-docker | xargs -r -I{} -n1 docker ps -q -a -f volume={} | xargs -r docker rm -f
sudo apt-get purge -y nvidia-docker
```

Step 2: add the necessary repository, then update the apt package index:

```
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | \
  sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/ubuntu16.04/amd64/nvidia-docker.list | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update
```

Step 3: install ``` nvidia-docker ``` plugin:

```
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
sudo pkill -SIGHUP dockerd
```

Step 4: Verify the installation

Lets run latest CUDA image

```
docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi

```

From Docker version [19.03](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/38828), Docker provide device requests modules to support NVIDIA GPUs. So, installation of docker plugin is not required.

In case unavailability of Docker, it can be installed by following instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


### General usage:

#### Test nvidia-smi with the latest official CUDA image
```
docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi
```

#### Start a GPU enabled container on two GPUs
```
docker run --gpus 2 nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi
```

#### Starting a GPU enabled container on specific GPUs
```
docker run --gpus '"device=1,2"' nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi
docker run --gpus '"device=UUID-ABCDEF,1"' nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi
```


#### Create a GPU-enabled docker container with python tensorflow library in ubuntu distribution.

```
docker run --gpus all -it tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu bash
```

#### Create a GPU-enabled docker container with python pytorch library in ubuntu distribution.

```
docker run --gpus all -it  pytorch/pytorch:latest bash
```

Note: Here ``` tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu ``` and ``` pytorch/pytorch:latest ``` are docker images available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/). To get interactive pseudo tty session ``` -it ``` or ``` -i -t ``` or ``` -ti ``` can be used.

#### To list existing running containers

```
docker container ls
```

Note: In the output, first column will give you <containers id> of your container. 
  
#### To list existing all containers
 
```
docker container ls -a
```

#### To attach a container

Make sure container is running 

```
docker attach <container id>
```

if container is not running, start the container first by executing following command

```
docker start <container id>
```


#### To stop container service

Inside the container session

```
exit
```

Outside the container or in the main server

```
docker stop <container id>
```

#### To rename container

While creating the containers, if container name is not provided, docker name the container with some random string(can be found in the last column of container list). To rename the string with your chosen name following command can be used.

```
docker rename oldname newname
```

#### To remove container

```
docker rm <container id>
```

#### To list images

```
docker image ls
```

#### To remove image

To remove or delete docker image, make sure there is no linked container exist to that image.

```
docker image rm <image id>
```
